### NAME AND WEBSITE:

`enslikeprotocol.eth` ([`enslikeprotocol.eth.limo`](https://enslikeprotocol.eth.limo))

### POINT OF CONTACT:

`enspunks.eth` 

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

I want to build ENS Like Protocol ("ELP"), a DApp built on gas free (IPFS + CCIP-Read) ENS records enabling users to decentrally "like" content across the web using their ENS name.

ENSpunks previously developed [LikeButton.eth](https://LikeButton.eth.limo) consistenting of a $❤️ token collectively owning LikeButton.eth.  $❤️ was popular within the ENS community but widespread adoption suffered from high network costs (gas), even on L2s. The $❤️ token 

ENS records have always been a solution to the problems of supply, distribution, and pointing to content. However, historically ENS records have been outright cost prohibitive, at times costing as much as $10 in network fees to add a custom ENS record. 

Using recently released IPFS and CCIP-Read opensource ENS infrastructure, developed by NameSys, I want to launch ELP as the first in a new class of DApps developed on ENS records that are token, NFT and gas free.  

#### UX/UI 

- **`Connecting your Wallet and Selecting an ENS Name`:** 
   
   Users "install the DApp" by minting a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  Users can do this on enslikeprotocol.eth.limo and automatically set the IPFS + CCIP-Read gas free resolver.  Our users can mint the subdomain on any other platform and change the ENS resolver of their ❤️ subdomain too resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can create (and delete)  [❤️: content link] ENS records on UI the user can access at both <user>.enslikeprotocol.eth.limo and ❤️.<user>.eth.limo.  

- **`The ❤️ Social Graph` :**

  ENS users will be able to search ENS names and view their ❤️ ENS records through the UI. The ❤️  social graph will be interoperable with other protocols and social graphs such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).  

### PAST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON ENS
ENSpunks.eth has been with the ENS ecosystem for several years worked on the follows:

#### `Searchd.eth`
[Searchd.eth](https://searchd.eth.limo), fromerly [Geocities.eth](https://geocities.eth.limo),  is a .eth website search engine and general resource connecting ENS users with the ENS ecosystem for building on ENS names.

#### `LikeButton.eth`
[LikeButton.eth](https://likebutton.eth.limo) was the initial iteration of a "decentralized like button" for the ENS community.

#### `BoredENSYachtClube.eth`
[BoredENSYachtClube.eth](https://BoredENSYachtClube.eth.limo) is an pre-namewrapper ENS subdomain collection using a custom contract using IPFS data, CCIP-Read and ENS Wild Card Resolution.  Almost 1,000 subdomains were minting forming formed a ENS community sub-DAO where members used their subdomains to vote in snapshots that determined how the Club delegate voted in the DAO votes and Small Grants.
