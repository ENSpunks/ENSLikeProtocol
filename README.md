### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

ENS Like Protocol (ELP) is a opensource system and method for liking content across the web built on ENS records.

ENSpunks previously launched [LikeButton.eth](https://LikeButton.eth.limo) a community owned ENS name consistenting of a $❤️ ownership tokens. $❤️ was popular within the ENS community; however,  widespread adoption was never achieved in part due to network fees.   

Using new IPFS and CCIP-Read infrastructure ELP will create a interoperable and open social graph gas free on ENS records.  ELP will help introduce scale integration and adoption of ENS records to a million ENS names with records set.

#### UX/UI 

- **`Connecting your Wallet and Selecting an ENS Name`:** 
   
   Users "install the DApp" by minting a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  Users can do this on enslikeprotocol.eth.limo and automatically set the IPFS + CCIP-Read gas free resolver.  Or users can mint the subdomain on any other platform and manually change the ENS resolver to resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can manage (create and delete) gas free ❤️ ENS records [❤️: content link]  on a user friendly UI the user can access decentrally on their own subdomain decentralized website ❤️.<user>.eth.limo. 

- **`The ❤️ Social Graph` :**

  ENS users will be able to search ENS names and view their ❤️ ENS records through the UI. However, the ❤️  social graph will be open and interoperable with other protocols such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).  

### PAST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON ENS
ENSpunks.eth has experimented in the ENS ecosystem for several years, including:

#### `Searchd.eth`
[Searchd.eth](https://searchd.eth.limo), fromerly [Geocities.eth](https://geocities.eth.limo), a .eth website search engine and general resource for ENS users.

#### `LikeButton.eth`
[LikeButton.eth](https://likebutton.eth.limo)  the first iteration of a "decentralized like button" for the ENS community built with $❤️.

#### `BoredENSYachtClub.eth`
[BoredENSYachtClube.eth](https://BoredENSYachtClube.eth.limo) is an pre-namewrapper ENS subdomain collection using a custom contract leveraging IPFS data, CCIP-Read and ENS Wild Card Resolution.  Almost 1,000 subdomains were minting forming a ENS community sub-DAO where members have used their subdomains to vote in snapshots that determined how the delegate voted in the ENS DAO for elections and Small Grants.
