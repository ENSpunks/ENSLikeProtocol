### NAME AND WEBSITE:

### POINT OF CONTACT:

### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

ENS Like Protocol (ELP) is a opensource system and method for liking content across the web built using ENS records powered by IPFS + CCIP-Read infrastructure.

ENSpunks previously developed [LikeButton.eth](https://LikeButton.eth.limo) consistenting of a $❤️ token. $❤️ was popular within the ENS community but widespread adoption was never achieved in part due to network fees, even when reduced using L2 solutions. 

Using new IPFS and CCIP-Read infrastructure a ELP will create a interoperable and open social graph gas free on ENS records.  ELP will help introduce ENS users and developers to DApps built on ENS records and help scale ENS record usage to a million unique ENS names.

#### UX/UI 

- **`Connecting your Wallet and Selecting an ENS Name`:** 
   
   Users "install the DApp" by minting a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  Users can do this on enslikeprotocol.eth.limo and automatically set the IPFS + CCIP-Read gas free resolver.  Or users can mint the subdomain on any other platform and manually change the ENS resolver to resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can manage (create and delete) gas free ❤️ ENS records [❤️: content link]  on a user friendly UI the user can access decentrally on their own subdomain decentralized website ❤️.<user>.eth.limo.  

- **`The ❤️ Social Graph` :**

  ENS users will be able to search ENS names and view their ❤️ ENS records through the UI. However, the ❤️  social graph will be open and interoperable with other protocols such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).  

### PAST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON ENS
ENSpunks.eth has been part of the ENS ecosystem for several years, including:

#### `Searchd.eth`
[Searchd.eth](https://searchd.eth.limo), fromerly [Geocities.eth](https://geocities.eth.limo), a .eth website search engine and general resource for ENS users.

#### `LikeButton.eth`
[LikeButton.eth](https://likebutton.eth.limo)  the first iteration of a "decentralized like button" for the ENS community built with $❤️.

#### `BoredENSYachtClub.eth`
[BoredENSYachtClube.eth](https://BoredENSYachtClube.eth.limo) is an pre-namewrapper ENS subdomain collection using a custom contract using IPFS data, CCIP-Read and ENS Wild Card Resolution.  Almost 1,000 subdomains were minting forming formed a ENS community sub-DAO where members used their subdomains to vote in snapshots that determined how the Club delegate voted in the DAO votes and Small Grants.
