### WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BUILD ON ENS?

ENS Like Protocol (ELP) is a opensource system and method for liking content across the web built on gasless ENS records.

ENSpunks previously launched [LikeButton.eth](https://LikeButton.eth.limo) using a non-financial $❤️ token.  $❤️ was popular within the ENS community and as a way for one ENS user to send another ENS user ❤️ onchain.  One dev from the ENS community built a $❤️ chrome extension making it easy to give ❤️ on Twitter, and the eth.photos ENS record viewer integrated a ❤️ counter in their ENS profiles.  However, likebutton.eth was operated as a public good while failing to obtain public goods funding, and network fees slowed adoption. 

Using IPFS and CCIP-Read infrastructure ELP will solve the problems with likebutton.eth.  Specifically, ELP will be a tokenless and gasless method for creating "❤️ ENS records" that can point to content across the web.  More generally, ELP is a new type of DApp built on ENS records.  ELP hopes to help scale ENS records adoption to a million users with ENS records set, then a million daily active users setting ENS records.

#### Specs 

- **`Connecting your Wallet and Selecting an ENS Name`:** 
   
   Users mint a ❤️ subdomain on their own ENS name (Ex.: ❤️.enspunks.eth).  Users mint ❤️ subdomain on their name on enslikeprotocol.eth.limo and automatically set the gas free IPFS + CCIP-Read resolver.  Users can also mint the ❤️ subdomain on ENS.domains and manually change the ENS resolver to resolver.enslikeprotocol.eth.  

- **`Creating ENS ❤️ Records` :**  

   Users can manage (create and delete) gas free ❤️ ENS records [❤️: content link]  on a user friendly UI at ❤️.<user>.eth.limo. 

- **`The ❤️ Social Graph` :**

  ENS users can search ENS names and view their ❤️ ENS records through the UI. However, the ❤️  social graph will be open and interoperable with other protocols and platforms such as Ethereum Follow Protcol (EFP).  

### PAST EXPERIENCE WORKING ON ENS
ENSpunks.eth has been building in the ENS ecosystem for several years, projects include:

#### `Searchd.eth`
[Searchd.eth](https://searchd.eth.limo), fromerly [Geocities.eth](https://geocities.eth.limo), a .eth website search engine and general resource for ENS users.

#### `LikeButton.eth`
[LikeButton.eth](https://likebutton.eth.limo)  the first experiment with a "decentralized like button" for the ENS community built with $❤️.

#### `BoredENSYachtClub.eth`
[BoredENSYachtClube.eth](https://BoredENSYachtClube.eth.limo) is an pre-namewrapper ENS subdomain collection built with IPFS, CCIP-Read and ENS Wild Card Resolution.  Almost 1,000 subdomains were minted creating a ENS community sub-DAO where members discuss ENS DAO Small Grants, and vote their subdomains on snapshot collectively voting the community $ENS in the ENS DAO.
